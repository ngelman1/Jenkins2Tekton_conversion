Functionality tested in each pipeline:

Pipeline 1: Transfers and appends a message across pipeline stages.
Pipeline 2: Transforms a string based on user selection from a dropdown.
Pipeline 3: Extracts numbers from a string, calculates their sum, and formats the output.

Each folder contains the original jenkinsfile (under folder witht the pipeline's name) and the folder for the Tekton Conversion made by gpt and gemini models
